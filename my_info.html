        <p class="margin">
            I am a student in the 
            <a href="http://www.ece.utoronto.ca/">Electrical and Computer Engineering Department</a>
            , University of Toronto. My choices of streams are software and communication. During 
            the two years of study in the University, I was on the Dean's Honors List for my high
            academic performance. And at the same time, I have had several successful work experiences
            and personal projects.<br>
            <br>
            I firmly believe that a design process require efficient communication
            with the clients/users to make it robust and usable. Throughout the process, difficulties 
            will occur. And it is the engineer's job to recursively try out various methods to fulfill
            the basic functionalities. In the end, it takes the patience of the engineers to eventually 
            craft and realize the design.

            Being an engineer, I focus on applying my theoretical knowledge to solving real-world problems.

                        I have been taking courses from coursera attentively to broaden the scope
                        of my knowledge. The coursers I took are not limited to science and technology.
                        I have also taken interest in social science and humanity courses. Here is the 
                        link to a list of courses I completed, along with the certificates I earned.

                        I wrote this little program to monitor price changes
                        on Nike and Amazon. The program will tell you whether the item on your wishlist is on
                        sale. So one can get their sports accessories and electronic gears at a cheaper price!
                        The Github link contains the implementation of the project.

                        And I also made it a web server to host my website (which is essentially the one you
