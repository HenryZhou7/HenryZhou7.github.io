        <h2 id="about">About Me</h2>
        <p class="margin">
            I am a student in the 
            <a href="http://www.ece.utoronto.ca/">Electrical and Computer Engineering Department</a>
            , University of Toronto. My choices of streams are software and communication. During 
            the two years of study in the University, I was on the Dean's Honors List for my high
            academic performance. And at the same time, I have had several successful work experiences
            and personal projects.<br>
            <br>
            I firmly believe that a design process require efficient communication
            with the clients/users to make it robust and usable. Throughout the process, difficulties 
            will occur. And it is the engineer's job to recursively try out various methods to fulfill
            the basic functionalities. In the end, it will still take a great amount of time and effort to keep
            polishing and finalising the design in order to make it more efficient.
            <br>
            Right now, I am looking for any opportunities

            Being an engineer, I focus on applying my theoretical knowledge to solving real-world problems.
            Here is a 
            <a href="https://henryzhou7.github.io/work_experience.html">complete list</a>
            of my internships / work experience.

            In addition to some internships, I would deploy things I have learnt into real-life events. The process of myself (or with a small team)
            working on a project and eventually making an idea into reality is what makes me happy. Here is a list of my personal projects.

            I'd very much like to engage myself in some social activities.
